"""Run the layout: `pythonw -m miryoku` (or double-click `miryoku.pyw`).

Set the Windows keyboard to English (US). The key left of 1 (§) is the escape
key: tap it to switch between this layout and your plain keyboard, hold it for
2 seconds to quit. Between the thumb keys, hold B to dictate or N to speak a
task for the agent. Both need the assistant, started by `workspace.pyw`.
