    "hold" if another key is pressed AND released while it is down, or if it is
    held past the tapping term. Otherwise it is a tap.

    Chordal hold: for home row mods, if the first other key pressed is on the same
    hand, it is a tap, decided at once. You use a modifier with the other hand, so
    a same-hand key means a fast roll, not a shortcut. Holding past the tapping
    term still always makes it a modifier.

    Quick tap: tap a tap-hold key and press it again within `QUICK_TAP_MS`, and
    the second press is that key held down, so it repeats (Backspace, Space...).

    Typing streak: right after a typed character, a home row mod (except Shift) is
    a letter immediately. Shift is exempt so capitals after a space still work;
    layer thumbs are exempt so symbols and numbers inside words still work.

    Caps word: holding both Shift keys turns it on (or off). Letters then come out
    capitalised until something that isn't part of a word: a space, punctuation,
    Enter, an arrow... Digits, `_`, Backspace and Delete keep it going.

    Spacebar holds dictation; B toggles dictation; N toggles agent speech.
    A second toggle press stops speech, as does disabling the layout.
    Hold-to-talk tools on the Tools layer retain their press/release behavior.

    Snippets: the last characters typed are remembered; once they end in a
    snippet's trigger, the trigger is erased and the snippet typed instead.

    Layer lock: the lock key on a layer keeps that layer on after its thumb is
    released. Tap the lock key again, or the escape key, to unlock.
